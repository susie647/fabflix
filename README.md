1. Demo video URL 
	(Project 1): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq9lA9oqXO4&feature=youtu.be
	(Project 2): https://youtu.be/Xd9wJLdDiis
(In the demo video, We accidentally showed the wrong saleDate in the beginning of the video! Later, we demonstrated adding to cart again and showed the updated table. Sorry for the inconvenience!)


2. How to deploy our application with Tomcat: 

	a. open your terminal and type "git clone https://github.com/UCI-Chenli-teaching/cs122b-spring20-team-125.git"; 

	b. prepare a movie data; 

	c. run "source create-table.sql" on your terminal; 

	d. run your movie data file to populate your moviedb database;

	e. run "mvn package" to generate .war file

	f. copy the .war file into Tomcat webapp folder to deploy the application


3. Substring matching design
	Users keyword will be searched via the following substring matching design:
		like 'ABC%': All strings that start with 'ABC'. E.g. 'ABCD' and 'ABCABC'.
		like '%XYZ': All strings that end with 'XYZ'. E.g. 'WXYZ' and 'ZZXYZ'.
		like '%AN%': All strings that contain the pattern 'AN' anywhere. E.g. 'LOS ANGELES' and 'SAN FRANCISCO'.


4. Queries with Prepared Statements
	
	





	MainParser.java
		select movies matching condition




5. Parsing Time Optimization

	We used two different optimization strategies including
		1. Save parsed data into files and use "load data" to store in sql
			files that save newly parsed data: newStars.txt, new Movies.txt, new StarsInMovies.txt

		2. Retrieve queries and store in local hash table
			hash table built for genres in MainParser.java, stars in CastParser.java

	Parsing time comparison
		naive approach with prepared statement and "set auto-commit off"
			1173.32s  ~approximately: 19m33s
		1. After enabled "load data": 
			566.95s   ~approximately: 9m25s 
		2. After enabled hash table and "load data"
			54.04s
	


6. Inconsistent data report

	Inconsistent data are generated by parser and stored in report.txt
