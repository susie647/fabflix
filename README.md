1. Demo video URL 

	    (Project 1): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xq9lA9oqXO4&feature=youtu.be
	
	    (Project 2): https://youtu.be/Xd9wJLdDiis
	
            (project 3): https://youtu.be/xt2HGkhLpQY

2. How to deploy our application with Tomcat: 

	    a. open your terminal and type "git clone https://github.com/UCI-Chenli-teaching/cs122b-spring20-team-125.git"; 

	    b. prepare a movie data; 

	    c. run "source create-table.sql" on your terminal; 

	    d. run your movie data file to populate your moviedb database;

	    e. run "mvn package" to generate .war file

	    f. copy the .war file into Tomcat webapp folder to deploy the application


3. Substring matching design

	    Users keyword will be searched via the following substring matching design:
	
		like 'ABC%': All strings that start with 'ABC'. E.g. 'ABCD' and 'ABCABC'.
		like '%XYZ': All strings that end with 'XYZ'. E.g. 'WXYZ' and 'ZZXYZ'.
		like '%AN%': All strings that contain the pattern 'AN' anywhere. E.g. 'LOS ANGELES' and 'SAN FRANCISCO'.


4. Queries with Prepared Statements


        AddMovieServlet.java
        https://github.com/UCI-Chenli-teaching/cs122b-spring20-team-125/blob/master/web-module/src/main/java/AddMovieServlet.java

        AddStarServlet.java
        https://github.com/UCI-Chenli-teaching/cs122b-spring20-team-125/blob/master/web-module/src/main/java/AddStarServlet.java
        
        LoginServlet.java
        https://github.com/UCI-Chenli-teaching/cs122b-spring20-team-125/blob/master/web-module/src/main/java/LoginServlet.java

        MovieListServlet.java
        https://github.com/UCI-Chenli-teaching/cs122b-spring20-team-125/blob/master/web-module/src/main/java/MovieListServlet.java
        
        PaymentServlet.java
        https://github.com/UCI-Chenli-teaching/cs122b-spring20-team-125/blob/master/web-module/src/main/java/PaymentServlet.java
        
        UpdateSalesServlet.java
        https://github.com/UCI-Chenli-teaching/cs122b-spring20-team-125/blob/master/web-module/src/main/java/UpdateSalesServlet.java
        

5. Parsing Time Optimization

	We used two different optimization strategies including
	
		1. Save parsed data into files and use "load data" to store in sql
			files that save newly parsed data: newStars.txt, new Movies.txt, new StarsInMovies.txt

		2. Retrieve queries and store in local hash table
			hash table built for genres in MainParser.java, stars in CastParser.java

	Parsing time comparison
	
		naive approach with prepared statement and "set auto-commit off"
			1173.32s  ~approximately: 19m33s
		1. After enabled "load data": 
			566.95s   ~approximately: 9m25s 
		2. After enabled hash table and "load data"
			54.04s
	


6. Parsing assumption & Inconsistent data report

        Parsing assumption:
        actor64.xml:
            for each actor, we retrieve stagename as star's name and dob as star's birth year
            star without name is considered inconsistent when inserting to database
        
        main32.xml:
            for each movie, we retrieve dirname as director, t as title, year as year, cat as genre and fid as movie's fid in our fidMid table
            movie without fid, title, director, year, or valid genre is considered inconsistent when inserting to database
            genre without matching category name on http://infolab.stanford.edu/pub/movies/doc.html#CATS is considered inconsistent when inserting to database
            
        actor64.xml:
            for each movie, we retrieve "is" as director, t as title, a as star, and f as movie's fid in our fidMid table
            star&movie pair without matching star name in star table, or matching movie title,year,and director, is considered inconsistent when inserting to database
        
        
	    Inconsistent data are generated by parser and stored in report.txt
